---

🎯 **Objective:**  
To evaluate the security and privacy functions of a VPN by performing a hands-on test using ProtonVPN. The task involved setting up a VPN, verifying IP change, checking encrypted traffic, and summarizing how VPNs contribute to secure internet use.

---

🔧 **Process:**

1. Registered for a **free ProtonVPN** account.
2. Installed ProtonVPN desktop client on Windows.
3. Connected to a **free server (Netherlands)**.
4. Verified IP change via [whatismyipaddress.com].
5. Opened secure websites to confirm **HTTPS encryption**.
6. Disconnected VPN to compare **speed and IP**.

📊 **Results:**

| Action                    | Observation                                   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| IP Masking                | ✅ Successfully changed IP address            |
| HTTPS Confirmation        | ✅ Lock icon appeared (traffic encrypted)     |
| Browsing Speed (VPN)      | ⚠️ Slight slowdown – expected                 |
| Browsing Speed (No VPN)   | ✅ Back to normal                             |
| DNS/IP Leak               | ❌ None observed                              |
