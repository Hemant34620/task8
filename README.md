## 🔐 Cybersecurity Internship Task  
**VPN Used:** ProtonVPN (Free Plan)  
**Tool Used:** [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)  

---

## 🧩 Objective

To set up and test ProtonVPN to understand how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide encryption, hide IP addresses, and improve online privacy. The task also evaluates performance differences, verifies IP masking, and summarizes key benefits and limitations of VPN technology.

---

## 🛠️ Steps Performed

1. **Signed up** for ProtonVPN free plan via [https://protonvpn.com](https://protonvpn.com).
2. **Downloaded and installed** ProtonVPN desktop client on Windows.
